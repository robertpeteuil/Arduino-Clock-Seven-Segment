This is a simple Arduino project that reads the time from a DS1307 module and displays it on a 7-Segment Display.  It also includes a spaeker for simple audio feedback, and two buttons for setting the time and other settings.  

NOTE:  This was written on Arduino 23.  If Arduino 1.0 (or later) is used, the I2C commands would need to be changed to thier new format.  This should only impact the RTC functions.  Future revisions of this code may add conditional compilation for Arduino 1.0.

The functions are seperated and named by device: 7-Segment Display, RTC, UART, Menu, etc...  This should make it easy for others to leverage.

Note, the project works with both the 'old' and 'new' version of Sparkfun's Serial 7-Segment display. The module versions differ in several ways:  the characters they can display, the commands they support, and even the brightness level (for a given setting). So, conditional complication was used to set functions for the proper device.  The appropriate device should be #defined in the SSclockInits.h file.
